Adobe Premiere doesn't support to re-import its TXT export of subtitles/captions.
This script converts a TXT subtitle export to a readable SRT format

## Run script

`python premiere-txt2srt-converter.py INPUT`

You will be asked to give the projects framerate. Enter the framerate like 25, 29.97, 30.
The script will create a new srt-file in the same location.
